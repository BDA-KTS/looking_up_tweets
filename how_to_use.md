## How to Use

![alt semantic search how to use](semantic-search-how-to-use.png#center)
### Prerequisites
- **Python v3.8** (preferably through Anaconda)
- This method requires a collection of social media posts in `JSON` format. Place the collection in the `corpora/` folder and update the file name in the `config.json` to point to your dataset (e.g., `tweets.20150430-223406.json`). For demonstration purposes, the method uses a sample dataset of NLTK tweets located in `corpora/tweets.20150430-223406.json`.
### Steps to Execute
1. **Set up a Virtual Environment**
   - Using Anaconda:
     ```bash
     >conda create -n semantic_search python=3.8
     >conda activate semantic_search
     >conda install -c conda-forge notebook
     >pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Using Python:
     ```bash
     >python -m venv semantic_search
     >cd semantic_search
     >Scripts\activate
     >cd ..
     >pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. **Run Jupyter Notebook**
   - Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
     ```bash
     >jupyter lab
     ```
   - Open and execute all cells in `lookup_socialmedia_posts.ipynb`.
3. **Update Inputs**
   - Add new queries (one per line) in `data/input_queries.txt`.
   - Update the path to your JSON collection in `[config.json](https://github.com/BDA-KTS/semantic-search-over_social-media-posts/blob/main/config.json)`.
4. **View Outputs**
   - Results are saved in `data/output.json`, including post IDs, text, and similarity scores.
  
### Input and Output Specification (With sample)
#### **Input**
- **User Query:** The easiest way to change the query is by editing the `/data/input_queries.txt`.
  - **Example Query:** The current file contains the following keywords:  
    - `Social Norms`  
    - `Cultural Identity`  
    - `Community Interaction`

 
  These keywords will be used to find tweets relevant to these topics in the dataset.

- **Input Dataset:** It can be social media posts in json format e.g., [Tweets](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet). We use NLTK sample tweets (`corpora/tweets.20150430-223406.json`) for demonstration.

#### **Output:**
- **Output Format:**  
  After running all the scripts in `semantic-search-over_social-media-posts.ipynb`, the results will be saved as a JSON file in the following location:  
  - **File:** `/data/output.json`  

- **Structure of Output:**  
  Each result in the JSON output file includes the following fields:  
  - `Post ID`: The unique identifier of the social media post.  
  - `Post Text`: The content of the post.  
  - `Similarity Score`: A numerical value (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating how closely the post matches the input query.  

- **Sample Output:**  
Below are the top-K most similar posts to the given query (with top-K set to 5 in this example):
