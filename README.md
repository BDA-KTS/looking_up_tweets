## Description
This method allows users to perform a semantic search across a collection of social media posts (e.g., tweets) and retrieve the most relevant posts for a given query. For example, a social scientist studying public discourse on topics like *social media*, *gender issues*, or *elections* can use this tool to identify posts that share a similar meaning to the input query.
